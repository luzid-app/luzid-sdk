# @luzid/grpc-connection

This is a light wrapper around the `nice-grpc` (Node.js) `nice-grpc-web` (all others)
dependencies to provide a unified interface for gRPC connections to the @luzid/grpc-client.

You most likely don't want to install this package directly but only use it as part of the
[@luzid/sdk](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@luzid/sdk) package.
